This mortgage calculator was built with modularity in mind. If the customer requires a pie chart in their application then you can use the chart seperately from the form thanks to the calculator service. The pie chart could be used completely seperately like in a mortgage lending app. If no pie chart is required then only the form can be used and ouputs setup to show all the data that is necessary.

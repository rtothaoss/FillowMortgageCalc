//this will hold the logic for the mortgage calc

// M = P [ I ( 1 + I )^N ] / [ ( 1 + I )^N â€“ 1 ]
// M = Monthly Payment
// P = Principal Amount(total amount borrow)
// I = Interest rate on the mortgage
// N = Number of periods(monthly mortgage payments)

// Calculations
// Home Price - Down Payment = Loan Amount
// Down Payment / Home Price = Down Payment Percentage * 100
// Down Payment Percentage / Home Price = Down Payment
// Loan Program (years) * 12
// Interest Rate 
// 
// Property Tax / Home Price = Property Tax Percentage * 100
// Home Price * (Property Tax Percentage / 100) = Property Tax
// Home Insurance added to Total Amount Per Year
// HOA dues * 12 added to Total Amount Per Year
